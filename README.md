### Note: This project is done and published only for educational purposes.
Some scripts for the Reverse engineered (old) API of CafeBazaar.   
Be aware that new Cafebazaar clients are using a new and easier API but this API is still working as of writing this.   
I've reverse-engineered CafeBazaar's API and developed these scripts between 2019-2021 to research the safety of their platform.

## FAQ
### What is CafeBazaar?
It's the biggest Android market in Iran.
### Why did you Reverse engineered their API?
To research about malwares on their market.
### If there is a new API, so what's the point?
At the time of my research, it was the only API. The point of publishing, however, is the complexity and their technique of adding multilayers to difficult the process of Reverse engineering.
### Your code and coding skills sucks.
Thanks for informing, but I know. I have to mention that this project never meant to be public so I didn't care about the readability.
